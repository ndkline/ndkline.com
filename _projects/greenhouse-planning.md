[Solar Innovations](https://solarinnovations.com/press-feed/greenhouse-planning-with-the-experts-at-solar-innovations/){: target="_blank" } released the first of many sites I built for them thus far. This site focuses on the greenhouse planning, but the framework and theme are highly reusable. They are destined to be used on at least 2 more planning sites such as "Conservatory Planning" or "Skylight Planning". 

The theme was developed with SASS. This allowed me to create a base theme and then apply the various branding styles. For example, if you visit [Greenhouse.Planning.Solar](https://greenhouse.planning.solar/){:}
