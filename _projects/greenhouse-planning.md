[Solar Innovations](https://solarinnovations.com/press-feed/greenhouse-planning-with-the-experts-at-solar-innovations/){: target="_blank" } released the first of a series of sites I built for them. This site focuses on the greenhouse planning, but the framework and theme are highly reusable. They are destined to be used on at least 2 more planning sites such as "Conservatory Planning" or "Skylight Planning". 

The theme was developed with SASS. This allowed me to create a base theme and then apply the various branding styles. For example, if you visit [Greenhouse.Planning.Solar](https://greenhouse.planning.solar){: target="_blank"} and [Planning.Solar](https://planning.solar){: target="_blank"} you can see the difference between two of the four themes.

The sites are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){: target="_blank"} and served up through an [NGINX](http://nginx.org/){: target="_blank"} webserver. This allows the site to be extremely performant. [This blog post](/blog/2018/01/31/highly-optimized-ssg-website.html) covers the performance and optimizations.
