Everyone's first program, "Hello World."

Below you'll find an example of the first use case from [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language). Ever since then people have been using it as a test phrase while developing, designing, or even hacking<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)</sup>.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}

{% endhighlight %}
