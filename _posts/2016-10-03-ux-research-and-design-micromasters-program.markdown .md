The [User Experience Research and Design MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/michiganx-user-experience-ux-research-and-design) program via [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and backed by [the University of Michigan](http://umich.edu/) begins tomorrow. I've enrolled for certification within the program and will be taking classes along side a coworker.

The MicroMasters is a series of 9 courses starting Oct. 4 and going until August.

As a web developer I have worn many hats; front-end dev, graphic designer, programmer, full stack developer, backend dev, systems administrator, and dev ops engineer. I've excelled in each of those fields because I have always taken a empathetic, user first approach to software development. This program only serves as accreditation to skills I already have and regularly use.
