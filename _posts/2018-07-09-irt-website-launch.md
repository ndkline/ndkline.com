So you have a slightly more democratic ownership structure. What else?

Organizations have this tendency of growing to the point where you can’t do anything. They crumble under their own weight. When organizations start growing, for some reason, people think you need to bring in people to help coordinate stuff, especially among different departments. That’s the beginning of the end. Now you have someone on board who doesn’t do anything. They just coordinate. And they have an interest in making sure there is always something to coordinate. So they start inventing problems that don’t really exist. We don’t have interdepartmental project managers. The people who actually do the work do that.

When you hire a developer, you look to see if they have specific experience in a particular language. They do, but when they arrive, they are only as useful as the direction you can give them, and since the PMs themselves are equally inexperienced, the product is inadequately formed. The experienced developer (who would have intuitively known and guided the Product manager what was best for the product development) is him/herself trying to differentiate on experience but losing on price to the cheapest commodity.

Often it seems that managers and other non-technical folk don’t understand that when you push productivity, but are willing to sacrifice quality—thus incurring technical debt—it’s like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

Sure, you might get a few more eggs out of the goose by wringing its neck and threatening it, but after some amount of time that dead goose is just going to stop laying eggs.
