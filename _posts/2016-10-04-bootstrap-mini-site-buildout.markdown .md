One of our techs at the [Carrara Education Technology Center](https://cetc.ed.psu.edu) is tasked with giving a start of semester presentation to all new-coming grad students. Typically he has a PowerPoint presentation he'll update yearly and print slides out for the students to reference. This year we tried something different.

I had a little bandwidth available so I offered to spin up a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) site. Millennials have a litany of devices to view a webpage on, the documents still can be printed if desired, and Bootstrap is easy so why not?!

So over the course of a day or so I threw together the [Understanding College of Education Resources](http://ed.psu.edu/resources/) page.
