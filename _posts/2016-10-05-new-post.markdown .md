Today we are launching the [Center for Education and Civil Rights](https://cecr.ed.psu.edu/) (CECR) website. [Ross Designs and Consulting](http://rossdc.com/) was contracted to build the site and produced quality work.

The site resides under one of the servers I administer and maintain. We're excited to be expanding our Drupal infrastructure in a more maintainable direction.
