I've been an active member of the Drupal community, specifically the <a href="https://drupal.psu.edu/" target="_blank">PSU's Drupal Users Group</a> at Penn State. I not only develop applications using Drupal but push the boundries with the technology using it with NodesJS and websockets (Socket.io), working with <a href="https://www.ostraining.com/blog/drupal/what-is-headless-drupal/" target="_blank">headless builds</a>, and being the pioneer adopter of the latest version of Drupal (8) at Penn State.
